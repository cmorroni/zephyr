	  Amount of memory reserved in each network buffer for user data. In

	  Interval in seconds of Network buffer allocation warnings which are
	  generated when a buffer cannot immediately be allocated with K_FOREVER
	  which may lead to deadlocks. Setting it to 0 makes warnings to be
	  printed only once per allocation.

	  Enable network buffer pool tracking. This means that:
	  * amount of free buffers in the pool is remembered
	  * total size of the pool is calculated
	  * pool name is stored and can be shown in debugging prints
