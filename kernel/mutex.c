/**
 * @file @brief mutex kernel services
 *
 * This module contains routines for handling mutex locking and unlocking.
 *
 * Mutexes implement a priority inheritance algorithm that boosts the priority
 * level of the owning thread to match the priority level of the highest
 * priority thread waiting on the mutex.
 *
 * Each mutex that contributes to priority inheritance must be released in the
 * reverse order in which it was acquired.  Furthermore each subsequent mutex
 * that contributes to raising the owning thread's priority level must be
 * acquired at a point after the most recent "bumping" of the priority level.
 *
 * For example, if thread A has two mutexes contributing to the raising of its
 * priority level, the second mutex M2 must be acquired by thread A after
 * thread A's priority level was bumped due to owning the first mutex M1.
 * When releasing the mutex, thread A must release M2 before it releases M1.
 * Failure to follow this nested model may result in threads running at
 * unexpected priority levels (too high, or too low).
